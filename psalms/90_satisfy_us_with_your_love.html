You have been our dwelling place
Oh everlasting God
Before you formed the mountaintops
You were before it all
And soon our lives turn back to dust

<i>
When the sun comes up satisfy us
Before the day has passed us by
Before our hearts forget all your goodness
Satisfy us with your love
</i>

The wrath of God poured out for sin
On Jesus crucified
Consider him our hiding place
Our shelter is alive
Because he lived and died for us

Teach us Lord to number our days on earth
And give us more wisdom in the secret heart
As you display amazing grace in Jesus Christ for us
