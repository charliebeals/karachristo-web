                    <p>
Christ our Redeemer died on the cross
Died for the sinner; paid all his due
Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb
And I will pass over you

When I see the blood
Of my holy One
My wrath shall be quneched
My judgements be through
When I see the blood
Of my holy Son
Yes I will pass over you

Chiefest of sinners Jesus will save
All He has promised that He will do
Wash in the fountain opened for sin
And I will pass over you

Judgement is coming; all will be due
Each one receiving justly his due
Hide in the saving sin-cleansing blood
And I will pass over you

O great compassion, O boundless love
O lovingkindness faithful and true
Find peace and shelter under the blood
And I will pass over you
                    </p>
