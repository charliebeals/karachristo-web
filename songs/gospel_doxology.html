C                Em
Who has held the oceans in his hands?
C                Em
Who has numbered every grain of sand?
C                 Em
Kings and nations tremble at his voice
C             Em
All creation rises to rejoice

C     G/B  Am                   F
Behold our God, seated on his throne

Come, let us adore him

Behold our king, nothing can compare
             C  G   C
Come, let us adore him

Who has given counsel to the Lord?
Who can question any of his words?
Who can teach, the one who knows all things?
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?

C     G/B  Am                   F
Behold our God, seated on his throne

Behold our king, nothing can compare
             C  G   C
Come, let us adore him

Who has felt the nails upon his hands?
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
God eternal, humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign

C     G/B  Am                   F
Behold our God, seated on his throne
              C    G/B
Come, let us adore him
C      G/B  Am                  F
Behold our king, nothing can compare
             C  G   C
Come, let us adore him
