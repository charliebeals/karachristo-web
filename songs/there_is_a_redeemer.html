There is a Redeemer
Jesus, God's own Son
Precious Lamb of God
Messiah, Holy One

Jesus, my Redeemer
Name above all names
Precious Lamb of God
Messiah, O for sinners slain

Thank You, O my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving us Your Spirit
'Til the work on earth is done

When I stand in glory
I will see His face
And there I'll serve
My King forever
In that holy place

Thank You, O my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving us Your Spirit
'Til the work on earth is done

There is a Redeemer
Jesus, God's own Son
Precious Lamb of God
Messiah, Holy One

Thank You, O my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving us Your Spirit
'Til the work on earth is done
