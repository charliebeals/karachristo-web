My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest friend
But wholly trust in Jesus name

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest friend
But wholly trust in Jesus name

Christ alone Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all

When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil

Christ alone Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found (Oh, yeah)
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne

Christ alone Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all
