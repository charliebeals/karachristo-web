                    <p>
From the depths of woe I raise to Thee
A voice of lamentation
Lord, turn a gracious ear to me
And hear my supplication
If Thou iniquities dost mark
Our secret sins and misdeeds dark

<i>M:</i> O who shall stand before Thee?
<i>W:</i> Who shall stand before Thee?
<i>M:</i> Who shall stand before Thee?
<i>W:</i> Who shall stand before Thee?

                      
To wash away the crimson stain
Grace, grace alone availeth
Our works, alas! are all in vain
In much the best life faileth
No man can glory in Thy sight
All must alike confess Thy might
                      
<i>M:</i> And live alone by mercy
<i>W:</i> Live alone by mercy
<i>M:</i> And live alone by mercy
<i>W:</i> Live alone by mercy

                      
Therefore my trust is in the Lord
And not in mine own merit
On Him my soul shall rest
His word upholds my fainting spirit
His promised mercy is my fort
My comfort and my sweet support
                      
<i>M:</i> I wait for it with patience
<i>W:</i> Wait for it with patience
<i>M:</i> I wait for it with patience
<i>W:</i> Wait for it with patience
                      
                      
What though I wait the live-long night
And till the dawn appeareth
My heart still trusteth in His might
It doubeth not nor feareth
Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed
Ye of the Spirit born indeed
                      
<i>M:</i> And wait till God appeareth
Wait till God appeareth
<i>M:</i> And wait till God appeareth
Wait till God appeareth

                      
Though great our sins and sore our woes
His grace much more aboundeth
His helping love no limit knows
Our upmost need it soundeth
Our Shepherd good and true is He
Who will at last His Israel free
                      
<i>M:</i> From all their sin and sorrow
<i>W:</i> All their sin and sorrow
<i>M:</i> From all their sin and sorrow
<i>W:</i> All their sin and sorrow
<i>M:</i> From all their sin and sorrow
<i>W:</i> All their sin and sorrow
