Holiness, holiness is what I long for
Holiness is what I need
Holiness, holiness
Is what You want from me

Holiness, holiness is what I long for

So, take my heart and form it
Take my mind and transform it
Take my will and conform it
To Yours, to Yours, oh, Lord

Faithfulness, faithfulness is what I long for
Faithfulness is what I need
Faithfulness, faithfulness
Is what you want from me

Righteousness, righteousness is what I long for
Righteousness is what I need
Righteousness, righteousness
Is what you want from me
