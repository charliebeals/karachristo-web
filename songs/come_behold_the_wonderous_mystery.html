Come behold the wondrous mystery, in the dawning of the King
He the theme of heaven’s praises, robed in frail humanity
In our longing, in our darkness, now the light of life has come
Look to Christ, who condescended, took on flesh to ransom us.


Come behold the wondrous mystery, he the perfect Son of Man
In his living, in his suffering, never trace nor stain of sin
See the true and better Adam, come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure fulfillment of the law, in him we stand.


Come behold the wondrous mystery, Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners hangs the Lamb in victory
See the price of our redemption, see the Father’s plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory, grace unmeasured, love untold


Come behold the wondrous mystery, slain by death the God of life
But no grave could e’er restrain him, praise the Lord, He is alive
What a foretaste of deliverance, how unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected, as will we be when he comes.
