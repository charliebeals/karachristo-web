Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,
  the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy
  health and salvation!
All ye who hear,
Now to His temple draw near;
Praise him in glad adoration!

Praise to the Lord, who oâ€™er all
  things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under his wings yea
  so gently sustaineth
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires ere have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper
  thy work and defend thee,
Surely his goodness and mercy
    here daily attend thee.
Ponder anrew what the Almighty can do,
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that
  is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come
  now with praises before Him!
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again;
Gladly forever we adore Him.
