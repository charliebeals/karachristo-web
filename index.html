                    Lansing is home to several gyms and workout facilities. There are numerous physical therapists and personal athletic trainers. There's a climbing wall on the west-side. There's a few simple options for low income families.

                <p>
                    Now for the first time, all of these are brought together under one roof. The L.E.A.R.N. Center, a proposed multi-use facility occuping space in the Meridian mall, aims to serve elite and aspiring athletes from all walks (and runs) of life. The fitness center will feature:

                <p>
                    We have issued RFPs for all of the projects for the main facility; requirements are being completed for the neighboring gym facility now.
                </p>
                <h4>June 11th</h4>
                <p>
                    Meridian Township has pledged support of the project, granting the initial permits needed to make building modifications to the former Yonkers building.
                </p>
                <h4>June 1st</h4>
                <p>
                    A deal was struck with Meridian Mall, allowing us to purchase rights to both the eastern and northern retail units. We will plan on using the high-ceilinged easter unit for the main facility and the northern unit for the indoor basketball and tennis courts.
