                <p>
                    <i>Providing all the citizens of the Greater Lansing Area with the tools and resources to grow physically in both ability and knowledge.</i>

                <p>
                    Heart disease and obesity are both on the rise. We know that exercise and physical fitness decrease the risk for these things, yet most people don't workout on any regular basis. We believe there are two primary hurdles that cause this, barriers that stop people from achieving health levels of physical activity: material and mental.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We address the material barrier by creating a space where people at any income level can have access to both professional equipment. The mental barrier is broken with granting access to our educational matrials and professional trainers, giving current and future athletes the knowledge they need to succeed in their fitness journey.
