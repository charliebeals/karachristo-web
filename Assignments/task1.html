            What is the purpose of your site?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To give an overview of the LEARN (Lansing Education and Recreation Network) Center, a proposed multi-use space to be built in an emptry mall retail unit.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Who is your audience?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Two primary groups: individual athletes who may want a fitness center/gym, and professional trainers/phyiscal therapists who want a central space to work with clients, complete with private office suites.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What is the desired audience reponse?
        </h3>
        <p>
            In a perfect world, every member of the athletic audience would sign up for a membership, and each of the trainer offices would be rented. We want every visitor to the website to, at the least, become interested and potentially come visit with a day pass. Because the center isn't open yet, sharing information about the plans and spreading the website on social media will be key in this early phase.
        </p>

            Website Design

        <h3>
            Structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            The site will be rather simple. The homepage will have a primarily two-column design, with the main column having basic introductory information about the project. The side column will show details, such as the current level of funding and contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
            A "membership" page will show the various services offered at different membership levels, as well as their prices. A "partners" page will have details about the suites and related services available to the personal trainers and phyiscal therapists. An "About Us" page will give information on LEARN, including vision, mission, and objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            A template page will be created. While not in scope for this project, this template could be used to create individual pages for each type of recreation and service offered at the center (i.e., indoor track, basketball courts, swimming lessions, climbing wall, etc.)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Navigation
        </h3>
        <p>
            The site will be navigated primarily though a main menu, availabe at the top of every page with the same style globally. This will have links to the homepage, about us page, activities page, and membership page. All other pages would be linked to from within those pages.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Theme
        </h3>
        <p>
            Gym websites have often been seen using many colors and bold fonts, but the move toward "clean and sophisticated" websites is entering even the gym and recreation industry. We will use simple, high contrast colors for background and text, with occasional colored text to highlight important information. We will use a simple sans-serif font. the primary colors for this site will be light grey, dark grey, and gold.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this is a simple website, we don't need to worry about being too obvious with links or navigation, as the average users of the website will be a younger, mostly technologically savvy crowd.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Viewport
        </h3>
        <p>
            The site needs to be highly functional on a desktop, but will be designed with primarily mobile use in mind, as most users will likely be on their phones.
